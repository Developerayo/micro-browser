  Ayo: I am thinking we should download the video and make sure the output is in mp4 because we specified mp4 and jupload to cloudnary and just share that link, or what do you think?

  Ademola: That should be better Cos youtube would seem like an embedded stuff. Besides, youtube has CSP stuff.

  Ayo: I would download a small video and try that. Do you see any other thing that would be causing this?

  Ademola: Sure! Do eeet!!!!!!!!!!

  Ademola: Susuke video.. Hehehe, didn't know you watch/like animes.

  Ayo: What!!!! Saw every episode of Naruto, haha and cuurently seeing Boruto hahah

  Ademola: Cool Ep 500 :)

  Ademola. Mad one on Boruto. Can't wait to see that fowl grown up and beating folks asses.

  Ayo: Boruto is shit and he makes too many dumb mistakes that makes me angry all the time :(
 
  Ademola: He's still a kid, abeg!

  Ayo: When naruto was young, he still had sense than him :(

  Ademola: Nah! Compare their age. Naruto only had sense from the sage mode thing.

  Ayo: Before he go to the sage mode part, he had sense while learning from kakashi, boruto is far too dumb :(

  Ademola: LOL

  Ayo: Let's go back to work please, hehe.
